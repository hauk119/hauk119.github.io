# Comp 20 Assignment 1

This project consists of a personal website including a home page with links to a resume and (fake) brief bio.

files:
	index.html 		# the homepage
	resume.html 	# a brief resume
	bio.html 		# a (fake) brief bio
	style.css 		# styling for above files


I asked Ani Hopkins for help fixing my mistakes in setting up GitHub, and Maddy Duke random questions about what methods she used for things just to quell anxiety

Approximate hours spent: ~15? They weren't all very productive though

As a sidenote: bio.html has a strange background color effect caused by my use of a gradient background. I couldn't figure out how to fix it.
